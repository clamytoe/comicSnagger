I wrote this script for my kids. I have limited bandwidth at home, so to prevent them each from reading them online at different times I decided to just download them once. 

You will need to have mechanize and BeautifulSoup in order to use. It's still using Python 2, but I'll try to convert it to 3. I hope it's pretty self explanatory, but I do plan on writing a more proper Readme once I have more time.

One thing to note, if you stop a download or your connection drops, check the last image. More than likely you will have to remove it if it didn't download completely. You can tell if there is nothing butblack towards to bottom of the image. If you re-run the script on the same comic, it will resume where it left off or download any new comics if you maintain the established file structure.
